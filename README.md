SVM
Support Vector Machine is a supervised Machine Learning algorithm widely used for solving different machine learning problems. Given a dataset,
the algorithm tries to divide the data using hyperplanes and then makes the predictions. SVM is a non-probabilistic linear classifier. 
While other classifiers, when classifying, predict the probability of a data point to belong to one group or the another, SVM directly
says to which group the datapoint belongs to without using any probability calculation.
